# Orders Console App — Refactoring Example

This is a sample C# console application demonstrating **refactoring procedural code into clean, maintainable, and testable code** using proper methods (procedures), model, and separation of functions/tasks.

The project includes:

- **Before:** messy, procedural code with everything in `ProcessOrders()`
- **After:** clean code with reusable methods, error handling, and structured logic

It’s intended as an example for developers and also as a portfolio piece for showcasing code refactoring skills.
